# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The export guide application is currently failing to deploy due to ESLint errors related to unused variables and imports. These errors are being treated as build failures in the CI environment, preventing successful deployment to production. This feature addresses the systematic cleanup of code quality issues to ensure reliable deployments while maintaining code standards.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to build successfully without ESLint errors, so that deployments can proceed without interruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the build process runs THEN the system SHALL complete without ESLint errors
2. WHEN unused imports are detected THEN the system SHALL either remove them or mark them as intentionally unused
3. WHEN unused variables are detected THEN the system SHALL either remove them or refactor the code to use them appropriately
4. WHEN the CI process runs THEN the system SHALL pass all linting checks

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent code quality standards, so that the codebase remains maintainable and follows best practices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing code THEN the system SHALL follow TypeScript and React best practices
2. WHEN imports are added THEN the system SHALL only include necessary dependencies
3. WHEN variables are declared THEN the system SHALL ensure they are used or properly handled
4. WHEN React hooks are used THEN the system SHALL include all required dependencies in dependency arrays

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want reliable build processes, so that deployments are predictable and don't fail due to code quality issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the deployment pipeline runs THEN the system SHALL complete the build phase successfully
2. WHEN ESLint rules are violated THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback during development
3. WHEN code is committed THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent quality standards
4. IF build errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a team member, I want to preserve existing functionality while fixing code quality issues, so that no features are broken during cleanup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN removing unused code THEN the system SHALL maintain all existing functionality
2. WHEN refactoring variables THEN the system SHALL preserve the original behavior
3. WHEN updating imports THEN the system SHALL ensure all used components remain available
4. WHEN making changes THEN the system SHALL not introduce new runtime errors
